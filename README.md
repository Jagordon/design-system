# Design System

One place for service teams to find and share the styles, components and patterns for designing DWP services.

## Get started

`npm install && npm start`

## Accessibility

The site uses `pa11y-ci` with `axe-core` and `htmlcs` (default) as runners. To run a11y tests:
`npm run reports`

This generates an HTML report for every website url in the `pa11y-ci-report` folder.
