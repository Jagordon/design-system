The DWP Design System is for everyone. It brings together the latest research, design and development to make sure it is representative and relevant for its users.

This depends on people sharing their research and experiences of the elements in use. Please tell us when you use something from the Design System by [contributing to the community backlog on GitHub](https://github.com/dwp/design-system-community-backlog/issues) or getting in touch with [the Design System team](/community/team).

- [Latest updates](/community/latest-updates) – New patterns and components and changes to the Design System website.
- [Roadmap](/community/roadmap) – Our plans for developing the Design System.
- [Backlog](/community/backlog) – Patterns and components we'll be working on next.
