# Styles

Make your service look and feel like DWP.

If you are using [DWP Frontend]() in your build or prototype, the coded examples in the Design System won’t need any additional styling.

If you need to apply styles manually, you should still follow existing DWP conventions. For example, don’t assign new meanings to colours, don’t change the style of buttons or adjust the thickness of borders on form inputs.

See all the [styles in the backlog](https://github.com/dwp/design-system).
