The timeline component to show a linear record of what has happened.

{{dsExample({
  name: 'timeline',
  example: 'default',
  height: 454
})}}

## When to use this pattern

Use the timeline when you need to show a history of information or events that can be followed in chronological order.

The timeline should show a brief overview of what has happened at each point and should not be used to show give intricate details of the task.


## When not to use this pattern

The timeline should not be used to include and show large amounts of information.

You should not use the timeline component if you need to let users know where they are in a journey.

## How it works

The timeline should display in chronological order with the newest item appearing at the top of the list.
