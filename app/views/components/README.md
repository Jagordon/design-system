# Components

Components are reusable parts of the user interface that have been made to support a variety of applications.

Individual components can be used in multiple different [patterns](/patterns) and contexts. For example, the [timeline]() component can be used at the side of the page or on a page of its own in full.

See all the [components in the backlog]().
