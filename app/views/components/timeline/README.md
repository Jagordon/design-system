The timeline component to show a linear record of what has happened.

{{dsExample({
  name: 'timeline',
  example: 'default',
  height: 454
})}}

## When to use this pattern

Use the timeline when you need to show a history of information or events that can be followed in chronological order.

The timeline should show a brief overview of what has happened at each point and should not be used to show give intricate details of the task.


## When not to use this pattern

You should not use the timeline component if you need to let users know where they are in a journey.

The timeline should not be used to include and show large amounts of information.


## How it works

The timeline should display in chronological order with the newest item appearing at the top of the list.

Show all entries in the timeline in a list. You should not use a reveal to hide entries from the user.

If a timeline entry has more information attached to it this should be linked to from the timeline and shown on a separate page.
