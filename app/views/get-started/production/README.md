This guide explains how to set up your project so you can start using the styles and coded examples in the DWP Design System in production.

## Before you start

First you must have followed the [GOV.UK Design System production setup guide](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/get-started/production/).


## Include DWP Frontend in your project

To start using DWP styles, components and patterns contained here, youâ€™ll need to include DWP Frontend in your project.

We recommend [installing DWP Frontend using npm](). Using this option, you will be able to:

- selectively include the CSS or JavaScript for individual components
- build your own styles or components based on the palette or typography and spacing mixins
- customise the build (for example, overriding colours or enabling global styles)
- use the component Nunjucks templates
