# Get started

The DWP Design System is an extension of the GOV.UK Design System. And has been designed to work in tandem with it. The DWP Design System contains styles, components and patterns that are:

- not yet in the GOV.UK Design System
- unique to DWP services

Therefore you should reference the GOV.UK Design System first. And only use this if you can't find what you need.
