# Components

Components are reusable parts of the user interface that designers across DWP have made to support a variety of applications.

Individual components can be used in multiple different [patterns](/patterns) and contexts. For example, the [timeline](/components/timeline) component can be used at the side of the page or on a page of its own.

These components should be used in addition to those in theÂ <a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/">GOV.UK design system</a>. We will share the design and research of these components with the GOV.UK Design System so they can be used more widely.

We use labels to show how ready they are for use:
- **Experimental** - more research is needed to validate and assure
- **Observed** - used in services but no focused research found
- **Retired** - replaced by GOV.UK Design System component
