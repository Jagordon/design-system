# Backlog

The DWP Design System is built upon the research and experience of teams across the DWP.

Anyone can propose, develop or contribute to new patterns and components, or suggest improvements to existing ones.

Here is a list of the components, patterns and updates currently on the [DWP Design System Community Backlog](https://github.com/dwp/design-system-community-backlog/projects/1). They can be:
- **Proposed** - someone has suggested a new component or pattern
- **To do** - the proposed component or pattern has been agreed and is ready to work on
- **In progress** - someone is working on the component or pattern
